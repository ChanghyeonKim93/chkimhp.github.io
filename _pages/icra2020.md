## (ICRA2020 submission) Man-made real-world datasets

### Characteristics
This dataset is used in ICRA 2020 submission to validate robust performance and 3-D reconstruction results in challenging circumstances with no points and straight lines.

Our datasets mainly intend to show the 

including the man-made modern building, 

### File Formats
We provide the RGB-D datasets from the ASUS Xtion Pro live in the following format.

#### Color Images and Depth Maps

We provide the time-stamped color and depth images as a tar.gz file (TGZ). 

* The **color** images are stored as 640x480 8-bit RGB images in PNG format.
* The **depth** images are stored as 640x480 16-bit monochrome images in PNG format.
* The color and depth images are already rectified using OpenNI driver from PrimeSense.
* The depth images are scaled by a factor of 1000, i.e., a pixel value of 1000 in the depth image denotes a distance of 1 meter from the camera. A pixel value of 0 means missing data.

#### Ground-truth Trajectories

We provide the ground-truth trajectories as a text file containing the translation and orientation of the camera in a fixed coordinate (Vicon). 

* Each line in the text file contains a single pose.
* The format of each line is 'time tx ty tz qx qy qz qw' as denoted in the text file.
* **time** (float) gives the UNIX system time.
* **tx ty tz** (3 floats) give the position of the color camera with respect to the fixed coordinates as defined by motion capture system.
* **qx qy qz qw** (4 floats) give the orientation of the color camera in form of a unit quaternion with respect to the fixed coordinates as defined by the motion capture system.
