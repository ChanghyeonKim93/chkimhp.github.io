## (ICRA2020 submission) Man-made real-world datasets
- - -
### Characteristics
These datasets are used in my submission to **ICRA 2020** to validate robust performance and 3-D reconstruction results in challenging circumstances with no points and straight lines.

The datasets include images taken in long and looped corridor, empty room in a modern building. Furthermore, 

### File Formats
We provide two 480 X 640 grayscale stereo images in PNG format. The calibration data (intrinsic and stereo extrinsic parameters) is provided as a form of **yaml** files.


#### Stereo Imgaes
with 12 cm baseline at 20 Hz by using oCamS-mono stereo camera [Provider][provider]. 
All images are accurately time-synchronized with respect to a hardware internal clock of oCamS stereo camera. 

* Resolution: 2 X 480 X 640 8 bits (unsigned char) grayscale
* File extension: PNG
* Frequency: 20 Hz

We provide the time-stamped stereo images as a tar.gz file (TGZ). 

* The **color** images are stored as 640x480 8-bit RGB images in PNG format.
* The **depth** images are stored as 640x480 16-bit monochrome images in PNG format.
* The color and depth images are already rectified using OpenNI driver from PrimeSense.
* The depth images are scaled by a factor of 1000, i.e., a pixel value of 1000 in the depth image denotes a distance of 1 meter from the camera. A pixel value of 0 means missing data.

#### Ground-truth
There is no ground truth of the datasets, but you can reasonably validate the VO and 3-D reconstruction performance by below rules:

1. *corridor_loop*: You can compare the start and end points of the estimated trajectories. We carefully move the camera to make both start and end points of the trajectory. Furthermore, the height throughout the trajectory is maintained consistently.

2. *empty_room_loop*: At both start and end images, an identical 9 x 8 checkerboard is observed. You can get a relative 3-D positions and poses of the start and edge images, and use to calculate a final distance error of the estimated trajectory.
