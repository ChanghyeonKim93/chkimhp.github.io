## [scalemvo] Author-collected SNU underground parking lots datasets
The datasets are used in our submission to **scalemvo paper**.

### Characteristics
We collect our own driving datasets, called SNU underground parking lots datasets. 
Different from the KITTI outdoor datasets, due to the absence of the external ground truth measurement such as the GPS/INS solution, we additionally record the 3-D LiDAR pointcloud, and we execute the LiDAR odometry and mapping (LOAM) on our datasets to obtain the accurate metric trajectory. 

We install three global shutter grayscale cameras, a 32-channel 3-D LiDAR, and a 6-axis IMU on the roof of the vehicle. All cameras are triggered to capture time-synchronized 10 Hz images by the digital signal from the Arduino MKR Zero microcontroller. All the sensors and the microcontroller communicate to the Linux laptop computer by the ethernet interface.

Our camera setting has L=1.45 m and the height of the cameras is H=1.55 m from the ground. Two main cameras face front, and an auxiliary camera is rotated left to 20 degrees.Intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of cameras, 3-D LiDAR and IMU are calibrated by using the LiDAR and camera extrinsic calibration module.

### How to use
After reading details below, you can download each dataset at the **Download List** section below.
The datasets are in the ROSBAG format.

### File Formats
We provide three image streams at 10 Hz from the grayscale global shutter cameras as .bag format (ROSBAG file).

### Imgae Sequences
All images are accurately time-synchronized by a hardware trigger generated by the microcontroller unit (Arduino MKR Zero). 

* Resolution: 1032 X 772 (8-bits monochrome) x 3
* Frequency: 10 Hz
