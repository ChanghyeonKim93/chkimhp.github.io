Currently, I'm with Robot Intelligence Team, Samsung Research, Seoul, South Korea. I studied in <a href="https://larr.snu.ac.kr/" target="_blank">LARR</a> (the former name of it 'ICSL') and graduated Ph.D. on aerospace engineering in Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea. 
Main research topic is **Visual-LiDAR-Inertial SLAM & 3D reconstruction** for robotics applications.
